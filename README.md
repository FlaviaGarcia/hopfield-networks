# Hopfield Networks

In this repository we implement a hopfield network from scratch. 

Hopfield Networks are autoassociative networks. This means that the input is `x` and the ouput is also `x`. The main applications of this type of network is to reproduce the orginial version from a noisy version or a partial version.
